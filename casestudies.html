            <p>Timeline: 12 months - ing <br> My role: UX lead from user research to its release</p>
            
          <h4 class="mt-5">Business context</h4>
          <p>For Prime services in Societe Generale, there had been multiple legacy tools divided by user profiles (external clients or internal operational employees) and departments (MARK or GBSU), etc. This cumbersome diversion had confused users and consequently the overall satisfaction was very low.</p>
            
          <h4 class="mt-5">UX challenges</h4>
          <p>Users could not find the relevant information and links to another pages on the homepage. Also, it was very confusing to navigate through its original menu.</p>

                <div class="ml-3">
                <h5>Implementation of suitable user research methods: Co-design workshop, user survey, usability testing, focus group, etc.</h5>
                <p>I love to analyse qualitative and quantitative results from the research and visualise them into design. We could simplify a lot of complicated repetitive data in co-design workshops, decide a global layout and order of contents on Homepage based on the user survey, tested our design with usability questionnaire and confirmed the business values throughout the series of focus groups.</p>

                <h5>Simplifed information architecture and its menu navigation</h5>
                <p>Users could not find what they wanted from the menu. This complicated and repetitive menu got organised throughout the card sorting workshops. I facilitated all these workshops and designed the solution based on their results.</p>

                <h5 class="mb-4">List of 'Scheduled reports' relocated to the top right of its page</h5>
                <p>Users found it difficult to browse today's schedules on the previous version and download them easily if needed. <br><br>To solve this pain point, I used some relevant design components, 'List' and 'Button with dropdown' to improve the interaction design. Also, usage of right icons and colours helped users understand the status of each report quickly at one glance.</p>

                <p>Users could not have an overview of multiple accounts at once. Also, it was not clear whether each account has positive or negative balance. <br><br>Users like hedge fund managers have a lot of accounts, so I've designed cards with carousel to be horizontally scrollable. Plus, red ($danger-red) and green ($success-green) colours in SG Design System are used contextually.</p>

                <p>User had no calender view to track their events effectively. Previously, it was just a list of events in the table without any visual cue or hierarchy. <br><br>Now, there are 'Monthly', 'Weekly' and 'Daily' views with trading events. Figures are in adaptive colours which improve the accessibility and readability on dark background.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">Usability testing</h4>  
            <p>We've done usability testing with users to validate the design solutions before starting development. It helped us confirm that users' pain points would be solved and prevented any waste of development cost.</p>
            
            
            <h4 class="mt-5">UX metrics</h4>
            <p>- User satisfaction measured by NPS scores has increased.</p>
            <p>- The components of the new homepage are viewed as useful/very useful across users in user survey (~50%+).</p>
            <p>- A lot of positive qualitative feedback has supported this digital transformation project for long term.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">Problem defined</h4>
          <p>In Societe Generale, which is a global corporation with around 150,000 employees around the world, it was not easy to search and find the information about others in the group.</p>
          <p>"When I first joined, I didn't know anyone and had no idea who I should contact if the only person I knew in the team was not there." (Product Owner, explaining why he kicked-off this side project)</p>

                <h5>An agile and small product team </h5>
                <p>It started from a small team: one UX designer from London (myself), one Product owner from Hong Kong and one software engineer from New York. This small team enabled us to be more productive and collaborative in this large corporation.</p>

                <h5>Easy to browse and search quickly</h5>
                <p>We discovered that employees do like to browse others in different teams, departments or countries, especially when they kick-off any new project or collaboration. To make it smooth and intuitive, we implemented the same interaction like Google Map based on the benchmark analysis.</p>

                <h5>Useful features specifically for corporate needs</h5>
                <p>We focused on users' behaviour such as searching others when we started a new project with other teams or checking who are their reporting lines. Also, there are many 'project teams' across multiple departments and teams. Thus, users want to see their 'project teams' at one glance, although they're all apart.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-5">Problem defined</h4>
          <p>Previous widget for Help center was too small to be found easily and not consistent with other widgets, 'My services' and 'My account'. Also, it was short of space to display sufficient amount of information, which had resulted in low readability.</p>

                <h5>Smooth and transparent internal communication</h5>
                <p>Since all the services in SG Markets platform would be impacted by this redesign, I had communicated with many UX designers, Product Owners, stakeholders and engineers than any other projects. Smooth and transparent communication could reduce the silo and technical debt.</p>

                <h5>Scalable design that can be iterated quickly in the near future</h5>
                <p>When we first started this project, a Product Owner had so many features in mind in heavy contents of ppt slides. However, I facilitated him to prioritise the most important features into MVP and started from small to be easily scalable. For instance, we designed and developed from the directory of FAQs and pushed it to the production first. Then, while gathering feedback from users, we iterated to add an additional feature, 'Instant feedback', which users can quickly rate the service with stars.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4 class="mt-5">Outcomes</h4>
              <p>- The new Help center was updated across all services in SG Markets at once, which reduced the development cost.</p>
              <p>- User feedback after production has been positive enough to prioritise the next feature, 'Instant feedback'.</p>
              <p>- The usage of Help center from services has highly increased.</p>
